Facebook Incognito
==================

Do you ever browse Facebook without logging in? Maybe a friend sent you a link and you don't have a Facebook account or you're browsing a page while incognito for some reason. At these times Facebook will annoyingly tell you to log in or sign up.

Facebook Incognito is a browser extension which removes this overlay and let's you browse the pages unhindered.

Installation
------------

### Chrome/Chromium

1. Go to [this page][web-store-page] on the Chrome Web Store
2. Click "Add to Chrome" and accept the permissions
3. Optionally go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`) and tick the "Allow in incognito" checkbox. This will ensure the extension works in incognito windows too
